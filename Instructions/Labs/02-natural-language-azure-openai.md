# Lab 02: Use Azure OpenAI SDKs in your app

## Lab scenario
With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your own application.

In the scenario for this exercise, you will perform the role of a software developer who has been tasked to implement an app that can use generative AI to help provide hiking recommendations. The techniques used in the exercise can be applied to any app that wants to use Azure OpenAI APIs.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Task 2: Deploy a model
- Task 3: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 4: Configure your application
- Task 5: Run your application

## Estimated time: 40 minutes

### Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource

Before you can use Azure OpenAI models, you must provision an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **OpenAI** and select **Azure OpenAI**.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **OpenAI** and select **Azure OpenAI**.

   ![](../media/openai8.png)

2. On **Azure AI Services | Azure OpenAI** blade, select **OpenAI-Lab02-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>**

   ![](../media/OpenAI_select.png)

3. In the Azure OpenAI resource pane, click on **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio** it will navigate to **Azure AI Studio**.

   ![](../media/openai_studio1.png)

4. In **Welcome to Azure OpenAI Service** page, click on **Create new deployment**.

   ![](../media/openai-lab01_t2_s2.png "Create a new deployment")

5. In the **Deployments** page, click on **+ Create new deployment**.
    
   ![](../media/openai-lab01_t2_s3.png "Create a new deployment")

7. Within the **Deploy model** pop-up interface, enter the following details:
    
    - **Deployment type**: Standard (1)
    - **Select a Model**: gpt-35-turbo-16k (2)
      
       >**Note**: if the 16k model isn't available, choose **gpt-35-turbo**
       
    - **Model version**: Auto-update to default (3)
    - **Deployment type**: Standard (4)
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 10K (5)
    - **Enable dynamic quota**: Enabled (6)
    - Click on **Create** (7)
  
      ![](../media/x991-1.png)

7. This will deploy a model that you will be playing around with as you proceed.

   > **Note**:You can ignore the "Failed to fetch deployments quota information" notification.
   
   > **Note**: Each Azure OpenAI model is optimized for a different balance of capabilities and performance. We'll use the **3.5 Turbo** model series in the **GPT-3** model family in this exercise, which is highly capable of language understanding. This exercise only uses a single model, however, deployment and usage of other models you deploy will work in the same way.

### Task 3: Set up an application in Cloud Shell

To show how to integrate with an Azure OpenAI model, we'll use a short command-line application that runs in Cloud Shell on Azure. Open up a new browser tab to work with Cloud Shell.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of the portal.

    ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png#lightbox)

2. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **Bash**. If you don't see this option, skip the step.

3. Within the Getting Started pane, select **Mount storage account**, select your **Storage account subscription** from the dropdown and click **Apply**.

   ![](../media/cloudshell-getting-started.png)

4. Within the **Mount storage account** pane, select **I want to create a storage account** and click **Next**.

   ![](../media/cloudshell-mount-strg-account.png)

5. Within the **Advanced settings** pane, enter the following details:

    - **Subscription**: Default- Choose the only existing subscription assigned for this lab (1).
    - **Region**: <inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> (2)
    - **Resource group**: Select **Use existing** (3)
      - openai-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>
    - **Storage account**: Select **Create new** (4)
      - storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject>
    - **File share**: Create a new file share named **none** (5)
    - Click **Create** (6)

        ![](../media/cloudshell-advanced-settings.png "Create storage advanced settings")

6. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the page, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the page to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

7. Once the terminal starts, enter the following command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called `azure-openai`.

    ```bash
   rm -r azure-openai -f
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-openai azure-openai
    ```
  
8. The files are downloaded to a folder named **azure-openai**. Navigate to the lab files for this exercise using the following command.

    ```bash
   cd azure-openai/Labfiles/02-azure-openai-api
    ```

    Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as a sample text file you'll use to test the summarization. Both apps feature the same functionality.

9. Open the built-in code editor, and observe the text file that you'll be summarizing with your model located at `text-files/sample-text.txt`. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```
    > **NOTE:** If you're prompted to **Switch to Classic Cloud Shell** after running the **code .** command, click on **Confirm** and perform step 8 and 9 again.

    # Add Azure OpenAI package
    from openai import AzureOpenAI
    ```

6.  In the application code for your language, replace the comment ***Initialize the Azure OpenAI client...*** with the following code to initialize the client and define our system message.

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
    // Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
    OpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClient(new Uri(oaiEndpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(oaiKey));
    
    // System message to provide context to the model
    string systemMessage = "I am a hiking enthusiast named Forest who helps people discover hikes in their area. If no area is specified, I will default to near Rainier National Park. I will then provide three suggestions for nearby hikes that vary in length. I will also share an interesting fact about the local nature on the hikes when making a recommendation.";
    ```

    **Python**: test-openai-model.py

    ```python
    # Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
    client = AzureOpenAI(
            azure_endpoint = azure_oai_endpoint, 
            api_key=azure_oai_key,  
            api_version="2024-02-15-preview"
            )
    
    # Create a system message
    system_message = """I am a hiking enthusiast named Forest who helps people discover hikes in their area. 
        If no area is specified, I will default to near Rainier National Park. 
        I will then provide three suggestions for nearby hikes that vary in length. 
        I will also share an interesting fact about the local nature on the hikes when making a recommendation.
        """
    ```

      >**Note**: Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.
    
7. Replace the comment ***Add code to send request...*** with the necessary code for building the request; specifying the various parameters for your model such as `messages` and `temperature`.

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
    // Add code to send request...
    // Build completion options object
    ChatCompletionsOptions chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
    {
        Messages =
        {
            new ChatRequestSystemMessage(systemMessage),
            new ChatRequestUserMessage(inputText),
        },
        MaxTokens = 400,
        Temperature = 0.7f,
        DeploymentName = oaiDeploymentName
    };

    // Send request to Azure OpenAI model
    ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(chatCompletionsOptions);

    // Print the response
    string completion = response.Choices[0].Message.Content;
    Console.WriteLine("Response: " + completion + "\n");
    ```

            {"role": "user", "content": input_text}
        ]
    )
    generated_text = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Print the response
    print("Response: " + generated_text + "\n")
    ```

8. Before saving the file , please ensure your code looks similar to the code provided below.

    **C#**: Program.cs

9. To save the changes made to the file, right-click on the file from the left pane in the code window and hit **Save**

   >**Note:** Make sure to indent the code by eliminating any extra white spaces after pasting it into the code editor.

### Task 5: Test your application

Now that your app has been configured, run it to send your request to your model and observe the response.

1. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    
    - **Python**: `python test-openai-model.py`

    > **Tip**: You can use the **Maximize panel size** (**^**) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

2. When prompted, enter the text `What hike should I do near Rainier?`.

3. Observe the output, taking note that the response follows the guidelines provided in the system message you added to the *messages* array.

4. Provide the prompt `Where should I hike near Boise? I'm looking for something of easy difficulty, between 2 to 3 miles, with moderate elevation gain.` and observe the output.

5. In the code file for your preferred language, change the *temperature* parameter value in your request to **1.0** and save the file.

6. Run the application again using the prompts above, and observe the output.

Increasing the temperature often causes the response to vary, even when provided the same text, due to the increased randomness. You can run it several times to see how the output may change. Try using different values for your temperature with the same input.
