# Lab 02: Integrate Azure OpenAI into your app

## Lab scenario
With the Azure OpenAI Service, developers can create chatbots, language models, and other applications that excel at understanding natural human language. The Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-trained AI models, as well as a suite of APIs and tools for customizing and fine-tuning these models to meet the specific requirements of your application. In this exercise, you'll learn how to deploy a model in Azure OpenAI and use it in your application to summarize text.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Task 2: Deploy a model
- Task 3: Set up an application in Cloud Shell
- Task 4: Configure your application
- Task 5: Run your application

## Estimated time: 40 minutes

### Task 1: Provision an Azure OpenAI resource

Before you can use Azure OpenAI models, you must provision an Azure OpenAI resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **Azure OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)**.

### Task 2: Deploy a model

To use the Azure OpenAI API, you must first deploy a model to use through the **Azure OpenAI Studio**. Once deployed, we will reference that model in our app.

1. In the **Azure portal**, search for **Azure OpenAI (1)** and select **Azure OpenAI (2)**.

   ![](../media/why1.png)

2. On **Azure AI Services | Azure OpenAI** blade, select **OpenAI-Lab02-<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"></inject>**

   ![](../media/OpenAI_select.png)

3. In the Azure OpenAI resource pane, click on **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio** it will navigate to **Azure AI Studio**.

   ![](../media/openai_studio1.png)

4. In **Welcome to Azure OpenAI service** page, click on **Create new deployment**.

   ![](../media/openai-lab01_t2_s2.png "Create a new deployment")

5. In the **Deployments** page, click on **+ Create new deployment**.
    
   ![](../media/openai-lab01_t2_s3.png "Create a new deployment")

7. Within the **Deploy model** pop-up interface, enter the following details:

    - **Select a Model (1)**: gpt-35-turbo
    
    - **Model version (2)**: Auto-update to default
    
    - **Deployment name (3)**: text-turbo
    
    - Click on **Advanced options (4)**
    
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands) (5)**: 10K
    
    - **Enable dynamic Quota (6)**: Enabled
    
    - Click on **Create (7)**
  
      ![](../media/why3.png "Deploy model configurations")

7. This will deploy a model that you will be playing around with as you proceed.

   > **Note**:You can ignore the "Failed to fetch deployments quota information" notification.
   
   > **Note**: Each Azure OpenAI model is optimized for a different balance of capabilities and performance. We'll use the **3.5 Turbo** model series in the **GPT-3** model family in this exercise, which is highly capable of language understanding. This exercise only uses a single model, however, deployment and usage of other models you deploy will work in the same way.

### Task 3: Set up an application in Cloud Shell

To show how to integrate with an Azure OpenAI model, we'll use a short command-line application that runs in Cloud Shell on Azure. Open up a new browser tab to work with Cloud Shell.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of the portal.

    ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png#lightbox)

2. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **Bash**. If you don't see this option, skip the step.  

3. If you're prompted to create storage for your Cloud Shell, ensure your subscription is specified and then select **Advanced Settings**.

   ![](../media/openai-labs_createstoragepane.png "Create storage advanced settings")

4. Within the **Advanced settings** pane, enter the following details:
    - **Subscription (1)**: Default- Choose the only existing subscription assigned for this lab.

    - **CloudShell region (2)**: <inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" />
    
    - **Resource group (3)**: Select **Use existing**
      
      - openai-<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"></inject>
    
    - **Storage account (4)**: Select **Create new**
      
      - storage<inject key="Deployment-id" enableCopy="false"></inject>
    
    - **File share (5)**: Create a new file share named **none**
    
    - Click **Create Storage (6)**

      ![](../media/storageaccreate1.png "Create storage advanced settings")

5. Make sure the type of shell indicated on the top left of the Cloud Shell pane is switched to *Bash*. If it's *PowerShell*, switch to *Bash* by using the drop-down menu.

6. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the page, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the page to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview). 

7. Once the terminal starts, enter the following command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called `azure-openai`.

   ```bash
   rm -r azure-openai -f
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-openai azure-openai
   ```
  
8. The files are downloaded to a folder named **azure-openai**. Navigate to the lab files for this exercise using the following command.

   ```bash
   cd azure-openai/Labfiles/02-azure-openai-api
   ```

Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as a sample text file you'll use to test the summarization. Both apps feature the same functionality.

Open the built-in code editor, and observe the text file that you'll be summarizing with your model located at `text-files/sample-text.txt`. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### Task 4: Configure your application

For this exercise, you'll complete some key parts of the application to enable using your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. In the code editor, expand the **CSharp** or **Python** folder, depending on your language preference.

2. Open the configuration file for your language

    - C#: `appsettings.json`
    
    - Python: `.env`
    
3. Update the configuration values to include the **endpoint** and **key** from the Azure OpenAI resource you created, as well as the model name that you deployed, `text-turbo`. Then save the file by right-clicking on the file from the left pane and hit **Save**.

4. Navigate to the folder for your preferred language and install the necessary packages

    **C#** : 

      ```bash
      cd CSharp
      dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 1.0.0-beta.9
      ```

    **Python** : 

      ```bash
      cd Python
      pip install python-dotenv
      pip install openai==1.2.0
      ```

5. Navigate to your preferred language folder, select the code file, and add the necessary libraries.

    **C#**: Program.cs

    ```csharp
    // Add Azure OpenAI package
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
    ```

    **Python**: test-openai-model.py

     ```python
     # Add OpenAI import
     from openai import AzureOpenAI
     ```

6. Open up the application code for your language and add the necessary code for building the request, which specifies the various parameters for your model such as `prompt` and `temperature`.

    **C#**: Program.cs

   ```csharp
   // Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
   OpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClient(new Uri(oaiEndpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(oaiKey));

   // Build completion options object
   ChatCompletionsOptions chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
   {
        Messages =
        {
            new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
            new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Summarize the following text in 20 words or less:\n" + text),
        },
        MaxTokens = 120,
        Temperature = 0.7f,
        DeploymentName = oaiDeploymentName
   };

   // Send request to Azure OpenAI model
   ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(chatCompletionsOptions);
   string completion = response.Choices[0].Message.Content;

   Console.WriteLine("Summary: " + completion + "\n");
   ```
    
   **Python**: test-openai-model.py

    ```Python
    # Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
    client = AzureOpenAI(
            azure_endpoint = azure_oai_endpoint, 
            api_key=azure_oai_key,  
            api_version="2023-05-15"
            )
        
    # Send request to Azure OpenAI model
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=azure_oai_model,
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=120,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following text in 20 words or less:\n" + text}
        ]
    )
        
    print("Summary: " + response.choices[0].message.content + "\n")
    ```
    
7. The modified code will look like as shown below:

   **C#**: Program.cs
      
    ```csharp
    // Implicit using statements are included
    using System.Text;
    using System.Text.Json;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json;
    using Azure;

    // Add Azure OpenAI package
    using Azure.AI.OpenAI;

    // Build a config object and retrieve user settings.
    IConfiguration config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
        .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
        .Build();
    string? oaiEndpoint = config["AzureOAIEndpoint"];
    string? oaiKey = config["AzureOAIKey"];
    string? oaiDeploymentName = config["AzureOAIDeploymentName"];

    // Read sample text file into a string
    string textToSummarize = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"../text-files/sample-text.txt");

    // Generate summary from Azure OpenAI
    GetSummaryFromOpenAI(textToSummarize);
        
    void GetSummaryFromOpenAI(string text)  
    {   
        Console.WriteLine("\nSending request for summary to Azure OpenAI endpoint...\n\n");

        if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(oaiEndpoint) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(oaiKey) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(oaiDeploymentName) )
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Please check your appsettings.json file for missing or incorrect values.");
            return;
        }

    // Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
    OpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClient(new Uri(oaiEndpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(oaiKey));

    // Build completion options object
    ChatCompletionsOptions chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
    {
        Messages =
        {
            new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
            new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Summarize the following text in 20 words or less:\n" + text),
        },
        MaxTokens = 120,
        Temperature = 0.7f,
        DeploymentName = oaiDeploymentName
    };

    // Send request to Azure OpenAI model
    ChatCompletions response = client.GetChatCompletions(chatCompletionsOptions);
    string completion = response.Choices[0].Message.Content;

    Console.WriteLine("Summary: " + completion + "\n");
    }  
    ```

    **Python**: test-openai-model.py
   
      ```python
      import os
      from dotenv import load_dotenv
      
      # Add Azure OpenAI package
      # Add OpenAI import
      from openai import AzureOpenAI
      
      
      def main(): 
              
          try: 
          
              # Get configuration settings 
              load_dotenv()
              azure_oai_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OAI_ENDPOINT")
              azure_oai_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OAI_KEY")
              azure_oai_model = os.getenv("AZURE_OAI_MODEL")
              
              # Read text from file
              text = open(file="../text-files/sample-text.txt", encoding="utf8").read()
              
              print("\nSending request for summary to Azure OpenAI endpoint...\n\n")
              
              # Add code to build request...
              # Initialize the Azure OpenAI client
              client = AzureOpenAI(
                      azure_endpoint = azure_oai_endpoint, 
                      api_key=azure_oai_key,  
                      api_version="2023-05-15"
                      )
      
              # Send request to Azure OpenAI model
              response = client.chat.completions.create(
                  model=azure_oai_model,
                  temperature=0.7,
                  max_tokens=120,
                  messages=[
                      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                      {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following text in 20 words or less:\n" + text}
                  ]
              )
      
              print("Summary: " + response.choices[0].message.content + "\n")
                      
      
          except Exception as ex:
              print(ex)
      
       if __name__ == '__main__': 
          main()
      ``` 

7. To save the changes made to the file, right-click on the file from the left pane in the code window and hit **Save**.

### Task 5: Run your application

Now that your app has been configured, run it to send your request to your model and observe the response.

1. In the Cloud Shell bash terminal, navigate to the folder for your preferred language.

1. Run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    
    - **Python**: `python test-openai-model.py`

1. Observe the summarization of the sample text file.

1. Navigate to your code file for your preferred language, and change the *temperature* value to `1`. Save the file.

1. Run the application again, and observe the output.

Increasing the temperature often causes the summary to vary, even when provided with the same text, due to the increased randomness. You can run it several times to see how the output may change. Try using different values for your temperature with the same input.

## Review

In this lab, you have accomplished the following:
- Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Deploy an OpenAI model within the Azure OpenAI studio
- Integrate Azure OpenAI models into your applications

### You have successfully completed the lab.
