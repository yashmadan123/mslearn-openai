# Get started with Azure OpenAI Service

## Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

This lab introduces you to Azure OpenAI Service, a powerful platform that integrates OpenAI's generative AI models with the Azure cloud environment. Designed to introduce you to its core concepts and capabilities, this lab will guide you through provisioning a resource, deploying models, and interacting with various features. Learn to set up and configure an Azure OpenAI resource, deploy models, experiment with the Completions and Chat playgrounds and acquire foundational skills in utilizing Azure's infrastructure for developing and refining AI-powered applications.

## Objective

Understand how to deploy Azure OpenAI Service, enabling you to integrate and explore OpenAI's advanced models within the secure and scalable Azure platform. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Get started with Azure OpenAI Service** - Gain experience in provisioning and configuring an Azure OpenAI resource, deploying an AI model (e.g., GPT-35-Turbo), exploring model interactions in the Completions and Chat playgrounds, experimenting with prompts and parameters for fine-tuning, and leveraging the model's capabilities for code generation.

## Pre-Requisites

Participants should have: Basic knowledge and understanding of the following

- **Azure Portal**: For managing and provisioning Azure resources.
- **Azure AI Studio**: For deploying models and experimenting with their capabilities, including features such as the Completions and Chat playgrounds.

## Architecture

This architecture allows users to leverage Azure's cloud infrastructure to deploy and interact with advanced AI models. Through the Azure Portal, users manage their resources, while Azure AI Studio provides the tools needed to deploy and test these models. The Completions and Chat playgrounds within Azure AI Studio enable hands-on experimentation and refinement, facilitating the development of robust AI-powered applications.
