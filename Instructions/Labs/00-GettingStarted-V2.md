# Use your own data and explore content filter with Azure OpenAI services

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

These hands-on labs will allow you to explore how the Azure OpenAI Service integrates your own data with the intelligence of the underlying large language model (LLM). You'll learn how to control the model's use of your data, either by limiting it to specific topics or by blending it with results from the pre-trained model. The Azure OpenAI Service includes default content filters designed to identify and remove potentially harmful prompts and completions, ensuring safer interactions. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to apply for custom content filters tailored to your specific needs, reinforcing responsible AI principles in your generative AI applications. Content filtering plays a vital role in a responsible AI strategy, and this lab will provide insight into its impact and effectiveness.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Use your own data with Azure OpenAI**: This hands-on exercise aims to provision an Azure OpenAI resource and deploy a model, observing its normal chat behavior initially. You will then connect your data, interact with the model using this data, set up and configure an application in Cloud Shell, and run it to test its functionality.
- **Explore content filters in Azure OpenAI**: This hands-on exercise aims to deploy an OpenAI model to generate natural language output and explore content filters to ensure the generated content meets desired standards. The content filtering system recognizes and responds to particular types of potentially dangerous content in input prompts and output completions.
  
## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with Azure OpenAI Service.
- Basic understanding of large language models and their applications.

## Architecture

The architecture flow involves using the Azure OpenAI Service to integrate your data with a large language model (LLM), allowing you to manage how the model interacts with your information by focusing on specific topics or blending it with pre-trained results. The service employs default content filters to detect and remove harmful content, and you can also apply custom filters tailored to your needs. This approach ensures that content filtering is effectively used to uphold responsible AI practices, providing insights into its role in maintaining secure and safe interactions.
