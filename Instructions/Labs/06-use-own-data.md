### Task 3: Observe normal chat behavior without adding your own data

Before connecting Azure OpenAI to your data, first observe how the base model responds to queries without any grounding data.

1. In the **Playground** section, select the **Chat** page. The **Chat** playground page consists of three main sections:

     - **Setup** - used to set the context for the model's responses.
    - **Chat session** - used to submit chat messages and view responses.
    - **Configuration** - used to configure settings for the model deployment.

3. In the **Configuration** section, ensure that your model deployment `text-turbo` is selected.
4. In the **Setup** area, select the default system message template to set the context for the chat session. The default system message is *You are an AI assistant that helps people find information*.
5. In the **Chat session**, submit the following queries, and review the responses:

    ```
    I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
    ```

    ```
    What are some facts about New York?
    ```

    Try similar questions about tourism and places to stay for other locations that will be included in our grounding data, such as London, or San Francisco. You'll likely get complete responses about areas or neighborhoods, and some general facts about the city.


### Task 4: Connect your data in the chat playground

Next, add your data in the chat playground to see how it responds with your data as grounding

### Task 5: Chat with a model grounded in your data

Now that you've added your data, ask the same questions as you did previously, and see how the response differs.

   ```
   I'd like to take a trip to New York. Where should I stay?
   ```

   ```
   What are some facts about New York?
   ```

You'll notice a very different response this time, with specifics about certain hotels and a mention of Margie's Travel, as well as references to where the information provided came from. If you open the PDF reference listed in the response, you'll see the same hotels as the model provided.

Try asking it about other cities included in the grounding data, which are Dubai, Las Vegas, London, and San Francisco.

> **Note**: **Add your data** is still in preview and might not always behave as expected for this feature, such as giving the incorrect reference for a city not included in the grounding data.

### Task 6: Set up an application in Cloud Shell

To show how to integrate with an Azure OpenAI model, we'll use a short command-line application that runs in Cloud Shell on Azure. Open up a new browser tab to work with Cloud Shell.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), select the **[>_]** (*Cloud Shell*) button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. A Cloud Shell pane will open at the bottom of the portal.

    ![Screenshot of starting Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon to the right of the top search box.](../media/cloudshell-launch-portal.png)

2. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **Bash**.


   ![](../media/cloudshell-bash.png)

3. Within the Getting Started pane, select **Mount storage account**, select your **Storage account subscription** from the dropdown and click **Apply**.

   ![](../media/cloudshell-getting-started.png)

4. Within the **Mount storage account** pane, select **I want to create a storage account** and click **Next**.

   ![](../media/cloudshell-mount-strg-account.png)

5. Within the **Advanced settings** pane, enter the following details:

    - **Subscription**: Default- Choose the only existing subscription assigned for this lab (1).
    - **Region**: Select <inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" /> (2)
    - **Resource group**: 
      - openai-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (3)
    - **Storage account name**:
      - str<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"></inject> (4)
    - **File share**: Create a new file share named **none** (5)
    - Click **Create** (6)

        ![](../media/cloudshell-advanced-settings.png "Create storage advanced settings")

6. Make sure the type of shell indicated on the top left of the Cloud Shell pane is switched to *Bash*. If it's *PowerShell*, switch to *Bash* by using the drop-down menu.

7. Once the terminal starts, enter the following command to download the sample application and save it to a folder called `azure-openai`.

    ```bash
   rm -r azure-openai -f
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-openai azure-openai
    ```

8. The files are downloaded to a folder named **azure-openai**. Navigate to the lab files for this exercise using the following command.

    ```bash
   cd azure-openai/Labfiles/06-use-own-data
    ```

    Applications for both C# and Python have been provided, as well as sample code we'll be using in this lab.

9. Open the built-in code editor, and you can observe the code files we'll be using in `sample-code`. Use the following command to open the lab files in the code editor.

    ```bash
   code .
    ```

### Task 7: Configure your application

For this exercise, you'll complete some key parts of the application to enable using your Azure OpenAI resource.

1. In the code editor, expand the language folder for your preferred language.

2. Open the configuration file for your language.

    - **C#**: `appsettings.json`
    - **Python**: `.env`

3. Navigate to the folder for your preferred language and install the necessary packages.

     **C#**:

    ```
    cd CSharp
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --version 1.0.0-beta.14
    ```

    **Python**:

    ```
    cd Python
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install openai==1.13.3
    ```

4. In the code editor from the left navigation pane, in the **CSharp** or **Python** folder, open the configuration file for your preferred language

    - **C#**: appsettings.json
    - **Python**: .env

5. Update the configuration values to include:
    - The  **endpoint** and a **key** from the Azure OpenAI resource you created (Which you copied in the previous task alternatively it is available on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal)
    - The **deployment name** you specified for your model deployment (available in the **Deployments** page in Azure OpenAI Studio that is **text-turbo**).
    - The endpoint for your AI search service (Which you copied in the previous task alternatively it is available in the **Url** value on the overview page for your AI search resource in the Azure portal).
    - A **key** for your search resource (available in the **Keys** page for your AI search resource in the Azure portal - you can use either of the admin keys)
    - The name of the search index (which should be `margiestravel`).

      ![](../media/x676.png)

6. Open the code file for your preferred language, and replace the comment ***Configure your data source*** with code to add the Azure OpenAI SDK library:

    **C#**: ownData.cs

    ```csharp
    // Configure your data source
    AzureSearchChatExtensionConfiguration ownDataConfig = new()
    {
            SearchEndpoint = new Uri(azureSearchEndpoint),
            Authentication = new OnYourDataApiKeyAuthenticationOptions(azureSearchKey),
            IndexName = azureSearchIndex
    };
    ```

    **Python**: ownData.py

    ```python
    # Configure your data source
    extension_config = dict(dataSources = [  
            { 
                "type": "AzureCognitiveSearch", 
                "parameters": { 
                    "endpoint":azure_search_endpoint, 
                    "key": azure_search_key, 
                    "indexName": azure_search_index,
                }
            }]
        )
    ```

7. Review the rest of the code, noting the use of the *extensions* in the request body that is used to provide information about the data source settings.

8. Save the changes to the code file.


## Task 8: Run your application

Now that your app has been configured, run it to send your request to your model and observe the response. You'll notice the only difference between the different options is the content of the prompt, all other parameters (such as token count and temperature) remain the same for each request.

1. In the interactive terminal pane, ensure the folder context is the folder for your preferred language. Then enter the following command to run the application.

    - **C#**: `dotnet run`
    - **Python**: `python ownData.py`

    > **Tip**: You can use the **Maximize panel size** (**^**) icon in the terminal toolbar to see more of the console text.

2. Review the response to the prompt `Tell me about London`, which should include an answer as well as some details of the data used to ground the prompt, which was obtained from your search service.

## Review

In this lab, you have accomplished the following:
-   Provisioned an Azure OpenAI resource
-   Deployed an OpenAI model within the Azure OpenAI studio
-   Used the power of OpenAI models to generate responses limited to a custom ingested data.

### You have successfully completed the lab.
